# Regarding OMZ libs - you may choose to use all of OMZ's lib like so:
# ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:lib

# -OR-

# choose only the specific libs you need:
#   ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:lib/clipboard.zsh
#   ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:lib/history.zsh
#   ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:lib/completion.zsh
# -OR-
# You may decide not to load anything from lib at all.

# Let's go ahead and use all of Oh My Zsh's lib directory.
ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:lib

# Add some programmer plugins
ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/git
